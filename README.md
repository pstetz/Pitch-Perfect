# Sound Analyzer

author: Patrick Stetz [(gihub)](https://github.com/pstetz)

# Introduction:

This project takes a .wav file and converts it to sheet music

# Important steps:

- Opens a wav file

- Segments the sound into notes

- Takes a fft and determines the note 

- Plots the note on sheet music.

# Advanced ideas:

- Determine dynamic (piano or forte)

- Able to convert mp3 files as well

- Able to handle multiple instruments

- Look at partials to determine the instrument

- Given sheet music outputs an wav/mp3 file


# Abandoned ideas:

- Create my own software that will plot the sheet music onto a staff and spit out a pdf instead of a music xml
